    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like

        Array of modal values.
    count : ndarray
        Array of counts for each mode.

    Notes
    -----
    The mode  is calculated using `numpy.unique`.
    In NumPy versions 1.21 and after, all NaNs - even those with different
    binary representations - are treated as equivalent and counted as separate
    instances of the same value.

    By convention, the mode of an empty array is NaN, and the associated count
    is zero.

# `moment` fits into the `_axis_nan_policy` pattern, but it is a bit unusual
# because the number of outputs is variable. Specifically,
# `result_to_tuple=lambda x: (x,)` may be surprising for a function that
# can produce more than one output, but it is intended here.
# When `moment is called to produce the output:
# - `result_to_tuple` packs the returned array into a single-element tuple,
# - `_moment_result_object` extracts and returns that single element.
# However, when the input array is empty, `moment` is never called. Instead,
# - `_check_empty_inputs` is used to produce an empty array with the
#   appropriate dimensions.
# - A list comprehension creates the appropriate number of copies of this
#   array, depending on `n_outputs`.
# - This list - which may have multiple elements - is passed into
#   `_moment_result_object`.
# - If there is a single output, `_moment_result_object` extracts and returns
#   the single output from the list.
# - If there are multiple outputs, and therefore multiple elements in the list,
#   `_moment_result_object` converts the list of arrays to a single array and
#   returns it.
# Currently this leads to a slight inconsistency: when the input array is
# empty, there is no distinction between the `moment` function being called
# with parameter `order=1` and `order=[1]`; the latter *should* produce
# the same as the former but with a singleton zeroth dimension.

    A moment is a specific quantitative measure of the shape of a set of
    points. It is often used to calculate coefficients of skewness and kurtosis
    due to its close relationship with them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
       Input array.
    order : int or array_like of ints, optional
       Order of central moment that is returned. Default is 1.
    axis : int or None, optional
       Axis along which the central moment is computed. Default is 0.
       If None, compute over the whole array `a`.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    center : float or None, optional
       The point about which moments are taken. This can be the sample mean,
       the origin, or any other be point. If `None` (default) compute the
       center as the sample mean.

    Returns
    -------
    n-th moment about the `center` : ndarray or float
       The appropriate moment along the given axis or over all values if axis
       is None. The denominator for the moment calculation is the number of
       observations, no degrees of freedom correction is done.

    Notes
    -----
    The k-th moment of a data sample is:

    .. math::

        m_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - c)^k

    Where `n` is the number of samples, and `c` is the center around which the
    moment is calculated. This function uses exponentiation by squares [1]_ for
    efficiency.

    Note that, if `a` is an empty array (``a.size == 0``), array `moment` with
    one element (`moment.size == 1`) is treated the same as scalar `moment`
    (``np.isscalar(moment)``). This might produce arrays of unexpected shape.

    """Compute the kurtosis (Fisher or Pearson) of a dataset.

    Kurtosis is the fourth central moment divided by the square of the

    the result to give 0.0 for a normal distribution.

    If bias is False then the kurtosis is calculated using k statistics to
    eliminate bias coming from biased moment estimators

    Use `kurtosistest` to see if result is close enough to normal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array
        Data for which the kurtosis is calculated.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which the kurtosis is calculated. Default is 0.
        If None, compute over the whole array `a`.
    fisher : bool, optional
        If True, Fisher's definition is used (normal ==> 0.0). If False,

    bias : bool, optional
        If False, then the calculations are corrected for statistical bias.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan. 'propagate' returns nan,

        values. Default is 'propagate'.

    Returns
    -------
    kurtosis : array
        The kurtosis of values along an axis, returning NaN where all values
        are equal.

    Examples
    --------
    In Fisher's definition, the kurtosis of the normal distribution is zero.
    In the following example, the kurtosis is close to zero, because it was
    calculated from the dataset, not from the continuous distribution.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import norm, kurtosis
    >>> data = norm.rvs(size=1000, random_state=3)
    >>> kurtosis(data)
    -0.06928694200380558

    The distribution with a higher kurtosis has a heavier tail.
    The zero valued kurtosis of the normal distribution in Fisher's definition
    can serve as a reference point.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> from scipy.stats import kurtosis

    >>> x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> distnames = ['laplace', 'norm', 'uniform']

    >>> for distname in distnames:
    ...     if distname == 'uniform':
    ...         dist = getattr(stats, distname)(loc=-2, scale=4)

    ...     ax.plot(x, y, label="{}, {}".format(distname, round(kur, 3)))
    ...     ax.legend()

    The Laplace distribution has a heavier tail than the normal distribution.
    The uniform distribution (which has negative kurtosis) has the thinnest
    tail.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to infer from measurements whether the weights of adult
    human males in a medical study are not normally distributed [2]_.
    The weights (lbs) are recorded in the array ``x`` below.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.array([148, 154, 158, 160, 161, 162, 166, 170, 182, 195, 236])

    The skewness test from [1]_ begins by computing a statistic based on the
    sample skewness.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.skewtest(x)
    >>> res.statistic
    2.7788579769903414

    Because normal distributions have zero skewness, the magnitude of this
    statistic tends to be low for samples drawn from a normal distribution.

    The test is performed by comparing the observed value of the
    statistic against the null distribution: the distribution of statistic
    values derived under the null hypothesis that the weights were drawn from
    a normal distribution.

    For this test, the null distribution of the statistic for very large
    samples is the standard normal distribution.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> dist = stats.norm()
    >>> st_val = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
    >>> pdf = dist.pdf(st_val)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> def st_plot(ax):  # we'll reuse this
    ...     ax.plot(st_val, pdf)
    ...     ax.set_title("Skew Test Null Distribution")
    ...     ax.set_xlabel("statistic")
    ...     ax.set_ylabel("probability density")
    >>> st_plot(ax)
    >>> plt.show()

    The comparison is quantified by the p-value: the proportion of values in
    the null distribution as extreme or more extreme than the observed
    value of the statistic. In a two-sided test, elements of the null
    distribution greater than the observed statistic and elements of the null
    distribution less than the negative of the observed statistic are both
    considered "more extreme".

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> st_plot(ax)
    >>> pvalue = dist.cdf(-res.statistic) + dist.sf(res.statistic)
    >>> annotation = (f'p-value={pvalue:.3f}\n(shaded area)')
    >>> props = dict(facecolor='black', width=1, headwidth=5, headlength=8)
    >>> _ = ax.annotate(annotation, (3, 0.005), (3.25, 0.02), arrowprops=props)
    >>> i = st_val >= res.statistic
    >>> ax.fill_between(st_val[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> i = st_val <= -res.statistic
    >>> ax.fill_between(st_val[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> ax.set_xlim(-5, 5)
    >>> ax.set_ylim(0, 0.1)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.005455036974740185

    If the p-value is "small" - that is, if there is a low probability of
    sampling data from a normally distributed population that produces such an
    extreme value of the statistic - this may be taken as evidence against
    the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the weights were not
    drawn from a normal distribution. Note that:

    - The inverse is not true; that is, the test is not used to provide
      evidence for the null hypothesis.
    - The threshold for values that will be considered "small" is a choice that
      should be made before the data is analyzed [3]_ with consideration of the
      risks of both false positives (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis)
      and false negatives (failure to reject a false null hypothesis).

    Note that the standard normal distribution provides an asymptotic
    approximation of the null distribution; it is only accurate for samples
    with many observations. For small samples like ours,
    `scipy.stats.monte_carlo_test` may provide a more accurate, albeit
    stochastic, approximation of the exact p-value.

    >>> def statistic(x, axis):
    ...     # get just the skewtest statistic; ignore the p-value
    ...     return stats.skewtest(x, axis=axis).statistic
    >>> res = stats.monte_carlo_test(x, stats.norm.rvs, statistic)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> st_plot(ax)
    >>> ax.hist(res.null_distribution, np.linspace(-5, 5, 50),
    ...         density=True)
    >>> ax.legend(['aymptotic approximation\n(many observations)',
    ...            'Monte Carlo approximation\n(11 observations)'])
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0062  # may vary

    In this case, the asymptotic approximation and Monte Carlo approximation
    agree fairly closely, even for our small sample.

    The kurtosis test from [1]_ begins by computing a statistic based on the

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.kurtosistest(x)

    (The test warns that our sample has too few observations to perform the

    the magnitude of this statistic tends to be low for samples drawn from a

    The comparison is quantified by the p-value: the proportion of values in
    the null distribution as extreme or more extreme than the observed
    value of the statistic. In a two-sided test in which the statistic is
    positive, elements of the null distribution greater than the observed
    statistic and elements of the null distribution less than the negative of
    the observed statistic are both considered "more extreme".

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> kt_plot(ax)
    >>> pvalue = dist.cdf(-res.statistic) + dist.sf(res.statistic)
    >>> annotation = (f'p-value={pvalue:.3f}\n(shaded area)')
    >>> props = dict(facecolor='black', width=1, headwidth=5, headlength=8)
    >>> _ = ax.annotate(annotation, (3, 0.005), (3.25, 0.02), arrowprops=props)
    >>> i = kt_val >= res.statistic
    >>> ax.fill_between(kt_val[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> i = kt_val <= -res.statistic
    >>> ax.fill_between(kt_val[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> ax.set_xlim(-5, 5)
    >>> ax.set_ylim(0, 0.1)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0211764592113868

    If the p-value is "small" - that is, if there is a low probability of
    sampling data from a normally distributed population that produces such an
    extreme value of the statistic - this may be taken as evidence against
    the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the weights were not
    drawn from a normal distribution. Note that:

    - The inverse is not true; that is, the test is not used to provide
      evidence for the null hypothesis.
    - The threshold for values that will be considered "small" is a choice that
      should be made before the data is analyzed [3]_ with consideration of the
      risks of both false positives (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis)
      and false negatives (failure to reject a false null hypothesis).

    Note that the standard normal distribution provides an asymptotic
    approximation of the null distribution; it is only accurate for samples
    with many observations. This is the reason we received a warning at the
    beginning of the example; our sample is quite small. In this case,
    `scipy.stats.monte_carlo_test` may provide a more accurate, albeit
    stochastic, approximation of the exact p-value.

    >>> def statistic(x, axis):
    ...     # get just the skewtest statistic; ignore the p-value
    ...     return stats.kurtosistest(x, axis=axis).statistic
    >>> res = stats.monte_carlo_test(x, stats.norm.rvs, statistic)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> kt_plot(ax)
    >>> ax.hist(res.null_distribution, np.linspace(-5, 5, 50),

    ...            'Monte Carlo approximation\n(11 observations)'])
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0272  # may vary

    Furthermore, despite their stochastic nature, p-values computed in this way
    can be used to exactly control the rate of false rejections of the null
    hypothesis [4]_.

    r"""Test whether a sample differs from a normal distribution.

    This function tests the null hypothesis that a sample comes
    from a normal distribution.  It is based on D'Agostino and
    Pearson's [1]_, [2]_ test that combines skew and kurtosis to
    produce an omnibus test of normality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array containing the sample to be tested.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to compute test. Default is 0. If None,
        compute over the whole array `a`.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float or array
        ``s^2 + k^2``, where ``s`` is the z-score returned by `skewtest` and
        ``k`` is the z-score returned by `kurtosistest`.
    pvalue : float or array
       A 2-sided chi squared probability for the hypothesis test.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to infer from measurements whether the weights of adult
    human males in a medical study are not normally distributed [3]_.
    The weights (lbs) are recorded in the array ``x`` below.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.array([148, 154, 158, 160, 161, 162, 166, 170, 182, 195, 236])

    The normality test of [1]_ and [2]_ begins by computing a statistic based
    on the sample skewness and kurtosis.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.normaltest(x)
    >>> res.statistic
    13.034263121192582

    (The test warns that our sample has too few observations to perform the
    test. We'll return to this at the end of the example.)
    Because the normal distribution has zero skewness and zero
    ("excess" or "Fisher") kurtosis, the value of this statistic tends to be
    low for samples drawn from a normal distribution.

    The test is performed by comparing the observed value of the statistic
    against the null distribution: the distribution of statistic values derived
    under the null hypothesis that the weights were drawn from a normal
    distribution.
    For this normality test, the null distribution for very large samples is
    the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> dist = stats.chi2(df=2)
    >>> stat_vals = np.linspace(0, 16, 100)
    >>> pdf = dist.pdf(stat_vals)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> def plot(ax):  # we'll reuse this
    ...     ax.plot(stat_vals, pdf)
    ...     ax.set_title("Normality Test Null Distribution")
    ...     ax.set_xlabel("statistic")
    ...     ax.set_ylabel("probability density")
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> plt.show()

    The comparison is quantified by the p-value: the proportion of values in
    the null distribution greater than or equal to the observed value of the
    statistic.

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> pvalue = dist.sf(res.statistic)
    >>> annotation = (f'p-value={pvalue:.6f}\n(shaded area)')
    >>> props = dict(facecolor='black', width=1, headwidth=5, headlength=8)
    >>> _ = ax.annotate(annotation, (13.5, 5e-4), (14, 5e-3), arrowprops=props)
    >>> i = stat_vals >= res.statistic  # index more extreme statistic values
    >>> ax.fill_between(stat_vals[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i])
    >>> ax.set_xlim(8, 16)
    >>> ax.set_ylim(0, 0.01)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0014779023013100172

    If the p-value is "small" - that is, if there is a low probability of
    sampling data from a normally distributed population that produces such an
    extreme value of the statistic - this may be taken as evidence against
    the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the weights were not
    drawn from a normal distribution. Note that:

    - The inverse is not true; that is, the test is not used to provide

    >>> res = stats.monte_carlo_test(x, stats.norm.rvs, statistic,
    ...                              alternative='greater')
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> ax.hist(res.null_distribution, np.linspace(0, 25, 50),

    0.0082  # may vary

    Furthermore, despite their stochastic nature, p-values computed in this way
    can be used to exactly control the rate of false rejections of the null
    hypothesis [5]_.

    Because the normal distribution has zero skewness and zero

    low for samples drawn from a normal distribution.

    The test is performed by comparing the observed value of the statistic

def percentileofscore(a, score, kind='rank', nan_policy='propagate'):
    """Compute the percentile rank of a score relative to a list of scores.

    A `percentileofscore` of, for example, 80% means that 80% of the
    scores in `a` are below the given score. In the case of gaps or
    ties, the exact definition depends on the optional keyword, `kind`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        A 1-D array to which `score` is compared.
    score : array_like
        Scores to compute percentiles for.
    kind : {'rank', 'weak', 'strict', 'mean'}, optional
        Specifies the interpretation of the resulting score.
        The following options are available (default is 'rank'):

          * 'rank': Average percentage ranking of score.  In case of multiple
            matches, average the percentage rankings of all matching scores.
          * 'weak': This kind corresponds to the definition of a cumulative
            distribution function.  A percentileofscore of 80% means that 80%
            of values are less than or equal to the provided score.
          * 'strict': Similar to "weak", except that only values that are
            strictly less than the given score are counted.
          * 'mean': The average of the "weak" and "strict" scores, often used
            in testing.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile_rank
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Specifies how to treat `nan` values in `a`.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan (for each value in `score`).
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    Returns
    -------
    pcos : float
        Percentile-position of score (0-100) relative to `a`.

    With multiple matches, note how the scores of the two matches, 0.6
    and 0.8 respectively, are averaged:

    >>> stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 3)
    70.0

    Only 2/5 values are strictly less than 3:

    >>> stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 3, kind='strict')
    40.0

    But 4/5 values are less than or equal to 3:

    >>> stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 3, kind='weak')
    80.0

    The average between the weak and the strict scores is:

    >>> stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 3, kind='mean')
    60.0

    Score arrays (of any dimensionality) are supported:

    >>> stats.percentileofscore([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], [2, 3])

    The geometric standard deviation describes the spread of a set of numbers

    --------
    gmean : Geometric mean
    numpy.std : Standard deviation

    Notes
    -----
    As the calculation requires the use of logarithms the geometric standard
    deviation only supports strictly positive values. Any non-positive or
    infinite values will raise a `ValueError`.
    The geometric standard deviation is sometimes confused with the exponent of
    the standard deviation, ``exp(std(a))``. Instead the geometric standard
    deviation is ``exp(std(log(a)))``.
    The default value for `ddof` is different to the default value (0) used
    by other ddof containing functions, such as ``np.std`` and ``np.nanstd``.

    Compute the interquartile range of the data along the specified axis.

    The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the 75th and
    25th percentile of the data. It is a measure of the dispersion
    similar to standard deviation or variance, but is much more robust
    against outliers [2]_.

    The ``rng`` parameter allows this function to compute other
    percentile ranges than the actual IQR. For example, setting
    ``rng=(0, 100)`` is equivalent to `numpy.ptp`.

    The IQR of an empty array is `np.nan`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int or sequence of int, optional
        Axis along which the range is computed. The default is to
        compute the IQR for the entire array.
    rng : Two-element sequence containing floats in range of [0,100] optional
        Percentiles over which to compute the range. Each must be
        between 0 and 100, inclusive. The default is the true IQR:
        ``(25, 75)``. The order of the elements is not important.
    scale : scalar or str or array_like of reals, optional
        The numerical value of scale will be divided out of the final
        result. The following string value is also recognized:

          * 'normal' : Scale by
            :math:`2 \sqrt{2} erf^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 1.349`.

        The default is 1.0.
        Array-like `scale` of real dtype is also allowed, as long
        as it broadcasts correctly to the output such that
        ``out / scale`` is a valid operation. The output dimensions
        depend on the input array, `x`, the `axis` argument, and the
        `keepdims` flag.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values
    interpolation : str, optional

        Specifies the interpolation method to use when the percentile
        boundaries lie between two data points ``i`` and ``j``.
        The following options are available (default is 'linear'):

          * 'linear': ``i + (j - i)*fraction``, where ``fraction`` is the
            fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i`` and ``j``.
          * 'lower': ``i``.
          * 'higher': ``j``.
          * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j`` whichever is nearest.
          * 'midpoint': ``(i + j)/2``.

        For NumPy >= 1.22.0, the additional options provided by the ``method``
        keyword of `numpy.percentile` are also valid.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the reduced axes are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the original array `x`.

    Returns
    -------
    iqr : scalar or ndarray
        If ``axis=None``, a scalar is returned. If the input contains
        integers or floats of smaller precision than ``np.float64``, then the
        output data-type is ``np.float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is
        the same as that of the input.

    Compute the median absolute deviation of the data along the given axis.

    The median absolute deviation (MAD, [1]_) computes the median over the
    absolute deviations from the median. It is a measure of dispersion
    similar to the standard deviation but more robust to outliers [2]_.

    The MAD of an empty array is ``np.nan``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which the range is computed. Default is 0. If None, compute
        the MAD over the entire array.
    center : callable, optional
        A function that will return the central value. The default is to use
        np.median. Any user defined function used will need to have the
        function signature ``func(arr, axis)``.
    scale : scalar or str, optional
        The numerical value of scale will be divided out of the final
        result. The default is 1.0. The string "normal" is also accepted,
        and results in `scale` being the inverse of the standard normal
        quantile function at 0.75, which is approximately 0.67449.
        Array-like scale is also allowed, as long as it broadcasts correctly
        to the output such that ``out / scale`` is a valid operation. The
        output dimensions depend on the input array, `x`, and the `axis`
        argument.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

        * 'propagate': returns nan
        * 'raise': throws an error
        * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    Returns
    -------
    mad : scalar or ndarray
        If ``axis=None``, a scalar is returned. If the input contains
        integers or floats of smaller precision than ``np.float64``, then the
        output data-type is ``np.float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is
        the same as that of the input.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.std, numpy.var, numpy.median, scipy.stats.iqr, scipy.stats.tmean,
    scipy.stats.tstd, scipy.stats.tvar

    Notes
    -----
    The `center` argument only affects the calculation of the central value
    around which the MAD is calculated. That is, passing in ``center=np.mean``
    will calculate the MAD around the mean - it will not calculate the *mean*
    absolute deviation.

    The input array may contain `inf`, but if `center` returns `inf`, the
    corresponding MAD for that data will be `nan`.

    Examples
    --------
    When comparing the behavior of `median_abs_deviation` with ``np.std``,
    the latter is affected when we change a single value of an array to have an
    outlier value while the MAD hardly changes:

    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, scale=1, random_state=123456)

    >>> stats.median_abs_deviation(x)

    The one-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that two or more groups have
    the same population mean.  The test is applied to samples from two or
    more groups, possibly with differing sizes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1, sample2, ... : array_like
        The sample measurements for each group.  There must be at least
        two arguments.  If the arrays are multidimensional, then all the
        dimensions of the array must be the same except for `axis`.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis of the input arrays along which the test is applied.
        Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        The computed F statistic of the test.
    pvalue : float
        The associated p-value from the F distribution.

    Warns
    -----
    `~scipy.stats.ConstantInputWarning`
        Raised if all values within each of the input arrays are identical.
        In this case the F statistic is either infinite or isn't defined,
        so ``np.inf`` or ``np.nan`` is returned.

    `~scipy.stats.DegenerateDataWarning`
        Raised if the length of any input array is 0, or if all the input
        arrays have length 1.  ``np.nan`` is returned for the F statistic
        and the p-value in these cases.

    Notes
    -----
    The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order
    for the associated p-value to be valid.

    1. The samples are independent.
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population.
    3. The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal.  This
       property is known as homoscedasticity.

    If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still
    be possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test (`scipy.stats.kruskal`) or
    the Alexander-Govern test (`scipy.stats.alexandergovern`) although with
    some loss of power.

    The length of each group must be at least one, and there must be at
    least one group with length greater than one.  If these conditions
    are not satisfied, a warning is generated and (``np.nan``, ``np.nan``)
    is returned.

    If all values in each group are identical, and there exist at least two
    groups with different values, the function generates a warning and
    returns (``np.inf``, 0).

    If all values in all groups are the same, function generates a warning
    and returns (``np.nan``, ``np.nan``).

    The algorithm is from Heiman [2]_, pp.394-7.

    Notes

    The use of this test relies on several assumptions.

    1. The samples are independent.
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population.
    3. Unlike `f_oneway`, this test does not assume on homoscedasticity,
       instead relaxing the assumption of equal variances.

    Input samples must be finite, one dimensional, and with size greater than
    one.

    We use `alexandergovern` to test the null hypothesis that all cities

        The confidence interval for the correlation coefficient.

        Compute the confidence interval for the correlation coefficient

        If `method` is not provided,
        The confidence interval is computed using the Fisher transformation
        F(r) = arctanh(r) [1]_.  When the sample pairs are drawn from a
        bivariate normal distribution, F(r) approximately follows a normal
        distribution with standard error ``1/sqrt(n - 3)``, where ``n`` is the
        length of the original samples along the calculation axis. When
        ``n <= 3``, this approximation does not yield a finite, real standard
        error, so we define the confidence interval to be -1 to 1.

        If `method` is an instance of `BootstrapMethod`, the confidence
        interval is computed using `scipy.stats.bootstrap` with the provided
        configuration options and other appropriate settings. In some cases,
        confidence limits may be NaN due to a degenerate resample, and this is

    r"""
    Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value for testing non-correlation.

    The Pearson correlation coefficient [1]_ measures the linear relationship
    between two datasets. Like other correlation
    coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no
    correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear relationship.
    Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative
    correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.

    This function also performs a test of the null hypothesis that the
    distributions underlying the samples are uncorrelated and normally
    distributed. (See Kowalski [3]_
    for a discussion of the effects of non-normality of the input on the
    distribution of the correlation coefficient.)
    The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (N,) array_like
        Input array.
    y : (N,) array_like
        Input array.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'greater', 'less'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the correlation is positive (greater than zero)

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
    method : ResamplingMethod, optional
        Defines the method used to compute the p-value. If `method` is an
        instance of `PermutationMethod`/`MonteCarloMethod`, the p-value is
        computed using
        `scipy.stats.permutation_test`/`scipy.stats.monte_carlo_test` with the
        provided configuration options and other appropriate settings.
        Otherwise, the p-value is computed as documented in the notes.

    Returns
    -------
    result : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.PearsonRResult`
        An object with the following attributes:

        statistic : float
            Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value associated with the chosen alternative.

        The object has the following method:

        confidence_interval(confidence_level, method)
            This computes the confidence interval of the correlation
            coefficient `statistic` for the given confidence level.
            The confidence interval is returned in a ``namedtuple`` with
            fields `low` and `high`. If `method` is not provided, the
            confidence interval is computed using the Fisher transformation
            [1]_. If `method` is an instance of `BootstrapMethod`, the
            confidence interval is computed using `scipy.stats.bootstrap` with
            the provided configuration options and other appropriate settings.
            In some cases, confidence limits may be NaN due to a degenerate
            resample, and this is typical for very small samples (~6
            observations).

    Warns
    -----
    `~scipy.stats.ConstantInputWarning`
        Raised if an input is a constant array.  The correlation coefficient
        is not defined in this case, so ``np.nan`` is returned.

    `~scipy.stats.NearConstantInputWarning`
        Raised if an input is "nearly" constant.  The array ``x`` is considered
        nearly constant if ``norm(x - mean(x)) < 1e-13 * abs(mean(x))``.
        Numerical errors in the calculation ``x - mean(x)`` in this case might
        result in an inaccurate calculation of r.

    Notes
    -----
    The correlation coefficient is calculated as follows:

    .. math::

        r = \frac{\sum (x - m_x) (y - m_y)}
                 {\sqrt{\sum (x - m_x)^2 \sum (y - m_y)^2}}

    where :math:`m_x` is the mean of the vector x and :math:`m_y` is
    the mean of the vector y.

    Under the assumption that x and y are drawn from
    independent normal distributions (so the population correlation coefficient
    is 0), the probability density function of the sample correlation
    coefficient r is ([1]_, [2]_):

    .. math::
        f(r) = \frac{{(1-r^2)}^{n/2-2}}{\mathrm{B}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{n}{2}-1)}

    where n is the number of samples, and B is the beta function.  This
    is sometimes referred to as the exact distribution of r.  This is
    the distribution that is used in `pearsonr` to compute the p-value when
    the `method` parameter is left at its default value (None).
    The distribution is a beta distribution on the interval [-1, 1],
    with equal shape parameters a = b = n/2 - 1.  In terms of SciPy's
    implementation of the beta distribution, the distribution of r is::

        dist = scipy.stats.beta(n/2 - 1, n/2 - 1, loc=-1, scale=2)

    The default p-value returned by `pearsonr` is a two-sided p-value. For a
    given sample with correlation coefficient r, the p-value is
    the probability that abs(r') of a random sample x' and y' drawn from
    the population with zero correlation would be greater than or equal
    to abs(r). In terms of the object ``dist`` shown above, the p-value
    for a given r and length n can be computed as::

        p = 2*dist.cdf(-abs(r))

    When n is 2, the above continuous distribution is not well-defined.
    One can interpret the limit of the beta distribution as the shape
    parameters a and b approach a = b = 0 as a discrete distribution with
    equal probability masses at r = 1 and r = -1.  More directly, one
    can observe that, given the data x = [x1, x2] and y = [y1, y2], and
    assuming x1 != x2 and y1 != y2, the only possible values for r are 1
    and -1.  Because abs(r') for any sample x' and y' with length 2 will
    be 1, the two-sided p-value for a sample of length 2 is always 1.

    For backwards compatibility, the object that is returned also behaves
    like a tuple of length two that holds the statistic and the p-value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> x, y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [10, 9, 2.5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
    >>> res = stats.pearsonr(x, y)
    >>> res
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.828503883588428, pvalue=0.021280260007523286)

    To perform an exact permutation version of the test:

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(7796654889291491997)
    >>> method = stats.PermutationMethod(n_resamples=np.inf, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y, method=method)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.828503883588428, pvalue=0.028174603174603175)

    To perform the test under the null hypothesis that the data were drawn from
    *uniform* distributions:

    >>> method = stats.MonteCarloMethod(rvs=(rng.uniform, rng.uniform))
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y, method=method)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.828503883588428, pvalue=0.0188)

    To produce an asymptotic 90% confidence interval:

    >>> res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.9)
    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.9644331982722841, high=-0.3460237473272273)

    And for a bootstrap confidence interval:

    >>> method = stats.BootstrapMethod(method='BCa', random_state=rng)
    >>> res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.9, method=method)
    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.9983163756488651, high=-0.22771001702132443)  # may vary

    There is a linear dependence between x and y if y = a + b*x + e, where
    a,b are constants and e is a random error term, assumed to be independent
    of x. For simplicity, assume that x is standard normal, a=0, b=1 and let
    e follow a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation s>0.

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> s = 0.5
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500, random_state=rng)
    >>> e = stats.norm.rvs(scale=s, size=500, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = x + e
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y).statistic
    0.9001942438244763

    This should be close to the exact value given by

    >>> 1/np.sqrt(1 + s**2)
    0.8944271909999159

    For s=0.5, we observe a high level of correlation. In general, a large
    variance of the noise reduces the correlation, while the correlation
    approaches one as the variance of the error goes to zero.

    It is important to keep in mind that no correlation does not imply
    independence unless (x, y) is jointly normal. Correlation can even be zero
    when there is a very simple dependence structure: if X follows a
    standard normal distribution, let y = abs(x). Note that the correlation
    between x and y is zero. Indeed, since the expectation of x is zero,
    cov(x, y) = E[x*y]. By definition, this equals E[x*abs(x)] which is zero
    by symmetry. The following lines of code illustrate this observation:

    >>> y = np.abs(x)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=-0.05444919272687482, pvalue=0.22422294836207743)

    A non-zero correlation coefficient can be misleading. For example, if X has
    a standard normal distribution, define y = x if x < 0 and y = 0 otherwise.
    A simple calculation shows that corr(x, y) = sqrt(2/Pi) = 0.797...,
    implying a high level of correlation:

    >>> y = np.where(x < 0, x, 0)
    >>> stats.pearsonr(x, y)
    PearsonRResult(statistic=0.861985781588, pvalue=4.813432002751103e-149)

    This is unintuitive since there is no dependence of x and y if x is larger
    than zero which happens in about half of the cases if we sample x and y.

    -----
    *Null hypothesis and p-values*

    The null hypothesis is that the true odds ratio of the populations
    underlying the observations is one, and the observations were sampled at
    random from these populations under a condition: the marginals of the
    resulting table must equal those of the observed table. Equivalently,
    the null hypothesis is that the input table is from the hypergeometric
    distribution with parameters (as used in `hypergeom`)
    ``M = a + b + c + d``, ``n = a + b`` and ``N = a + c``, where the
    input table is ``[[a, b], [c, d]]``.  This distribution has support
    ``max(0, N + n - M) <= x <= min(N, n)``, or, in terms of the values
    in the input table, ``min(0, a - d) <= x <= a + min(b, c)``.  ``x``
    can be interpreted as the upper-left element of a 2x2 table, so the
    tables in the distribution have form::

        [  x           n - x     ]
        [N - x    M - (n + N) + x]

    For example, if::

        table = [6  2]
                [1  4]

    then the support is ``2 <= x <= 7``, and the tables in the distribution
    are::

        [2 6]   [3 5]   [4 4]   [5 3]   [6 2]  [7 1]
        [5 0]   [4 1]   [3 2]   [2 3]   [1 4]  [0 5]

    The probability of each table is given by the hypergeometric distribution
    ``hypergeom.pmf(x, M, n, N)``.  For this example, these are (rounded to
    three significant digits)::

        x       2      3      4      5       6        7
        p  0.0163  0.163  0.408  0.326  0.0816  0.00466

    These can be computed with::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.stats import hypergeom
        >>> table = np.array([[6, 2], [1, 4]])
        >>> M = table.sum()
        >>> n = table[0].sum()
        >>> N = table[:, 0].sum()
        >>> start, end = hypergeom.support(M, n, N)
        >>> hypergeom.pmf(np.arange(start, end+1), M, n, N)
        array([0.01631702, 0.16317016, 0.40792541, 0.32634033, 0.08158508,
               0.004662  ])

    The two-sided p-value is the probability that, under the null hypothesis,
    a random table would have a probability equal to or less than the
    probability of the input table.  For our example, the probability of
    the input table (where ``x = 6``) is 0.0816.  The x values where the
    probability does not exceed this are 2, 6 and 7, so the two-sided p-value
    is ``0.0163 + 0.0816 + 0.00466 ~= 0.10256``::

        >>> from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='two-sided')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.10256410256410257

    The one-sided p-value for ``alternative='greater'`` is the probability
    that a random table has ``x >= a``, which in our example is ``x >= 6``,
    or ``0.0816 + 0.00466 ~= 0.08626``::

        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='greater')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.08624708624708627

    This is equivalent to computing the survival function of the
    distribution at ``x = 5`` (one less than ``x`` from the input table,
    because we want to include the probability of ``x = 6`` in the sum)::

        >>> hypergeom.sf(5, M, n, N)
        0.08624708624708627

    For ``alternative='less'``, the one-sided p-value is the probability
    that a random table has ``x <= a``, (i.e. ``x <= 6`` in our example),
    or ``0.0163 + 0.163 + 0.408 + 0.326 + 0.0816 ~= 0.9949``::

        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='less')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.9953379953379957

    This is equivalent to computing the cumulative distribution function
    of the distribution at ``x = 6``:

        >>> hypergeom.cdf(6, M, n, N)
        0.9953379953379957

    *Odds ratio*

    The calculated odds ratio is different from the value computed by the
    R function ``fisher.test``.  This implementation returns the "sample"
    or "unconditional" maximum likelihood estimate, while ``fisher.test``
    in R uses the conditional maximum likelihood estimate.  To compute the
    conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio, use
    `scipy.stats.contingency.odds_ratio`.

    Examples
    --------
    In [3]_, the effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute
    mountain sickness was investigated. The study notably concluded:

        Acetazolamide 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily were all efficacious for
        preventing acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide 250 mg was the lowest
        effective dose with available evidence for this indication.

    The following table summarizes the results of the experiment in which
    some participants took a daily dose of acetazolamide 250 mg while others
    took a placebo.
    Cases of acute mountain sickness were recorded::

                                    Acetazolamide   Control/Placebo
        Acute mountain sickness            7           17
        No                                15            5


    Is there evidence that the acetazolamide 250 mg reduces the risk of
    acute mountain sickness?
    We begin by formulating a null hypothesis :math:`H_0`:

        The odds of experiencing acute mountain sickness are the same with
        the acetazolamide treatment as they are with placebo.

    Let's assess the plausibility of this hypothesis with
    Fisher's test.

    >>> from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
    >>> res = fisher_exact([[7, 17], [15, 5]], alternative='less')
    >>> res.statistic
    0.13725490196078433
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0028841933752349743

    Using a significance level of 5%, we would reject the null hypothesis in
    favor of the alternative hypothesis: "The odds of experiencing acute
    mountain sickness with acetazolamide treatment are less than the odds of
    experiencing acute mountain sickness with placebo."

    .. note::

        Because the null distribution of Fisher's exact test is formed under
        the assumption that both row and column sums are fixed, the result of
        the test are conservative when applied to an experiment in which the
        row sums are not fixed.

        In this case, the column sums are fixed; there are 22 subjects in each
        group. But the number of cases of acute mountain sickness is not
        (and cannot be) fixed before conducting the experiment. It is a
        consequence.

        Boschloo's test does not depend on the assumption that the row sums
        are fixed, and consequently, it provides a more powerful test in this
        situation.

        >>> from scipy.stats import boschloo_exact
        >>> res = boschloo_exact([[7, 17], [15, 5]], alternative='less')
        >>> res.statistic
        0.0028841933752349743
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.0015141406667567101

        We verify that the p-value is less than with `fisher_exact`.

def spearmanr(a, b=None, axis=0, nan_policy='propagate',
              alternative='two-sided'):
    r"""Calculate a Spearman correlation coefficient with associated p-value.

    The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure
    of the monotonicity of the relationship between two datasets.
    Like other correlation coefficients,
    this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation.
    Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact monotonic relationship. Positive
    correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations
    imply that as x increases, y decreases.

    The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Spearman correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets. Although calculation of the
    p-value does not make strong assumptions about the distributions underlying
    the samples, it is only accurate for very large samples (>500
    observations). For smaller sample sizes, consider a permutation test (see
    Examples section below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : 1D or 2D array_like, b is optional
        One or two 1-D or 2-D arrays containing multiple variables and
        observations. When these are 1-D, each represents a vector of
        observations of a single variable. For the behavior in the 2-D case,
        see under ``axis``, below.
        Both arrays need to have the same length in the ``axis`` dimension.
    axis : int or None, optional
        If axis=0 (default), then each column represents a variable, with
        observations in the rows. If axis=1, the relationship is transposed:
        each row represents a variable, while the columns contain observations.
        If axis=None, then both arrays will be raveled.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

        * 'propagate': returns nan
        * 'raise': throws an error
        * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the correlation is positive (greater than zero)

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float or ndarray (2-D square)
            Spearman correlation matrix or correlation coefficient (if only 2
            variables are given as parameters). Correlation matrix is square
            with length equal to total number of variables (columns or rows) in
            ``a`` and ``b`` combined.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis
            is that two samples have no ordinal correlation. See
            `alternative` above for alternative hypotheses. `pvalue` has the
            same shape as `statistic`.

    Warns
    -----
    `~scipy.stats.ConstantInputWarning`
        Raised if an input is a constant array.  The correlation coefficient
        is not defined in this case, so ``np.nan`` is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider the following data from [3]_, which studied the relationship
    between free proline (an amino acid) and total collagen (a protein often
    found in connective tissue) in unhealthy human livers.

    The ``x`` and ``y`` arrays below record measurements of the two compounds.
    The observations are paired: each free proline measurement was taken from
    the same liver as the total collagen measurement at the same index.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> # total collagen (mg/g dry weight of liver)
    >>> x = np.array([7.1, 7.1, 7.2, 8.3, 9.4, 10.5, 11.4])
    >>> # free proline (μ mole/g dry weight of liver)
    >>> y = np.array([2.8, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6, 3.5, 4.6, 5.0])

    These data were analyzed in [4]_ using Spearman's correlation coefficient,
    a statistic sensitive to monotonic correlation between the samples.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.spearmanr(x, y)
    >>> res.statistic
    0.7000000000000001

    The value of this statistic tends to be high (close to 1) for samples with
    a strongly positive ordinal correlation, low (close to -1) for samples with
    a strongly negative ordinal correlation, and small in magnitude (close to
    zero) for samples with weak ordinal correlation.

    The test is performed by comparing the observed value of the
    statistic against the null distribution: the distribution of statistic
    values derived under the null hypothesis that total collagen and free
    proline measurements are independent.

    For this test, the statistic can be transformed such that the null
    distribution for large samples is Student's t distribution with
    ``len(x) - 2`` degrees of freedom.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> dof = len(x)-2  # len(x) == len(y)
    >>> dist = stats.t(df=dof)
    >>> t_vals = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
    >>> pdf = dist.pdf(t_vals)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> def plot(ax):  # we'll reuse this
    ...     ax.plot(t_vals, pdf)
    ...     ax.set_title("Spearman's Rho Test Null Distribution")
    ...     ax.set_xlabel("statistic")
    ...     ax.set_ylabel("probability density")
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> plt.show()

    The comparison is quantified by the p-value: the proportion of values in
    the null distribution as extreme or more extreme than the observed
    value of the statistic. In a two-sided test in which the statistic is
    positive, elements of the null distribution greater than the transformed
    statistic and elements of the null distribution less than the negative of
    the observed statistic are both considered "more extreme".

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> rs = res.statistic  # original statistic
    >>> transformed = rs * np.sqrt(dof / ((rs+1.0)*(1.0-rs)))
    >>> pvalue = dist.cdf(-transformed) + dist.sf(transformed)
    >>> annotation = (f'p-value={pvalue:.4f}\n(shaded area)')
    >>> props = dict(facecolor='black', width=1, headwidth=5, headlength=8)
    >>> _ = ax.annotate(annotation, (2.7, 0.025), (3, 0.03), arrowprops=props)
    >>> i = t_vals >= transformed
    >>> ax.fill_between(t_vals[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> i = t_vals <= -transformed
    >>> ax.fill_between(t_vals[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> ax.set_xlim(-5, 5)
    >>> ax.set_ylim(0, 0.1)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.07991669030889909  # two-sided p-value

    If the p-value is "small" - that is, if there is a low probability of
    sampling data from independent distributions that produces such an extreme
    value of the statistic - this may be taken as evidence against the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the distribution of total collagen
    and free proline are *not* independent. Note that:

    - The inverse is not true; that is, the test is not used to provide
      evidence for the null hypothesis.
    - The threshold for values that will be considered "small" is a choice that
      should be made before the data is analyzed [5]_ with consideration of the
      risks of both false positives (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis)
      and false negatives (failure to reject a false null hypothesis).
    - Small p-values are not evidence for a *large* effect; rather, they can
      only provide evidence for a "significant" effect, meaning that they are
      unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.

    Suppose that before performing the experiment, the authors had reason
    to predict a positive correlation between the total collagen and free
    proline measurements, and that they had chosen to assess the plausibility
    of the null hypothesis against a one-sided alternative: free proline has a
    positive ordinal correlation with total collagen. In this case, only those
    values in the null distribution that are as great or greater than the
    observed statistic are considered to be more extreme.

    >>> res = stats.spearmanr(x, y, alternative='greater')
    >>> res.statistic
    0.7000000000000001  # same statistic
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> pvalue = dist.sf(transformed)
    >>> annotation = (f'p-value={pvalue:.6f}\n(shaded area)')
    >>> props = dict(facecolor='black', width=1, headwidth=5, headlength=8)
    >>> _ = ax.annotate(annotation, (3, 0.018), (3.5, 0.03), arrowprops=props)
    >>> i = t_vals >= transformed
    >>> ax.fill_between(t_vals[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> ax.set_xlim(1, 5)
    >>> ax.set_ylim(0, 0.1)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.03995834515444954  # one-sided p-value; half of the two-sided p-value

    Note that the t-distribution provides an asymptotic approximation of the
    null distribution; it is only accurate for samples with many observations.
    For small samples, it may be more appropriate to perform a permutation
    test: Under the null hypothesis that total collagen and free proline are
    independent, each of the free proline measurements were equally likely to
    have been observed with any of the total collagen measurements. Therefore,
    we can form an *exact* null distribution by calculating the statistic under
    each possible pairing of elements between ``x`` and ``y``.

    >>> def statistic(x):  # explore all possible pairings by permuting `x`
    ...     rs = stats.spearmanr(x, y).statistic  # ignore pvalue

def pointbiserialr(x, y):
    r"""Calculate a point biserial correlation coefficient and its p-value.

    The point biserial correlation is used to measure the relationship
    between a binary variable, x, and a continuous variable, y. Like other
    correlation coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0
    implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply a determinative
    relationship.

    This function may be computed using a shortcut formula but produces the
    same result as `pearsonr`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like of bools
        Input array.
    y : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    res: SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
            The R value.
        pvalue : float
            The two-sided p-value.

    Notes
    -----
    `pointbiserialr` uses a t-test with ``n-1`` degrees of freedom.
    It is equivalent to `pearsonr`.

    The value of the point-biserial correlation can be calculated from:

    .. math::

        r_{pb} = \frac{\overline{Y_1} - \overline{Y_0}}
                      {s_y}
                 \sqrt{\frac{N_0 N_1}
                            {N (N - 1)}}

    Where :math:`\overline{Y_{0}}` and :math:`\overline{Y_{1}}` are means
    of the metric observations coded 0 and 1 respectively; :math:`N_{0}` and
    :math:`N_{1}` are number of observations coded 0 and 1 respectively;
    :math:`N` is the total number of observations and :math:`s_{y}` is the
    standard deviation of all the metric observations.

    A value of :math:`r_{pb}` that is significantly different from zero is
    completely equivalent to a significant difference in means between the two
    groups. Thus, an independent groups t Test with :math:`N-2` degrees of
    freedom may be used to test whether :math:`r_{pb}` is nonzero. The
    relation between the t-statistic for comparing two independent groups and
    :math:`r_{pb}` is given by:

    .. math::

        t = \sqrt{N - 2}\frac{r_{pb}}{\sqrt{1 - r^{2}_{pb}}}

               method='auto', variant='b', alternative='two-sided'):
    r"""Calculate Kendall's tau, a correlation measure for ordinal data.

    Kendall's tau is a measure of the correspondence between two rankings.
    Values close to 1 indicate strong agreement, and values close to -1
    indicate strong disagreement. This implements two variants of Kendall's
    tau: tau-b (the default) and tau-c (also known as Stuart's tau-c). These
    differ only in how they are normalized to lie within the range -1 to 1;
    the hypothesis tests (their p-values) are identical. Kendall's original
    tau-a is not implemented separately because both tau-b and tau-c reduce
    to tau-a in the absence of ties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of rankings, of the same shape. If arrays are not 1-D, they
        will be flattened to 1-D.
    initial_lexsort : bool, optional, deprecated
        This argument is unused.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0
           `kendalltau` keyword argument `initial_lexsort` is deprecated as it
           is unused and will be removed in SciPy 1.14.0.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan.
        The following options are available (default is 'propagate'):

          * 'propagate': returns nan
          * 'raise': throws an error
          * 'omit': performs the calculations ignoring nan values

    method : {'auto', 'asymptotic', 'exact'}, optional
        Defines which method is used to calculate the p-value [5]_.
        The following options are available (default is 'auto'):

          * 'auto': selects the appropriate method based on a trade-off
            between speed and accuracy
          * 'asymptotic': uses a normal approximation valid for large samples
          * 'exact': computes the exact p-value, but can only be used if no ties
            are present. As the sample size increases, the 'exact' computation
            time may grow and the result may lose some precision.
    variant : {'b', 'c'}, optional
        Defines which variant of Kendall's tau is returned. Default is 'b'.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:

        * 'two-sided': the rank correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the rank correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the rank correlation is positive (greater than zero)

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
           The tau statistic.
        pvalue : float
           The p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis is
           an absence of association, tau = 0.

    spearmanr : Calculates a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient.

    weightedtau : Computes a weighted version of Kendall's tau.

    Notes
    -----
    The definition of Kendall's tau that is used is [2]_::

      tau_b = (P - Q) / sqrt((P + Q + T) * (P + Q + U))

      tau_c = 2 (P - Q) / (n**2 * (m - 1) / m)

    where P is the number of concordant pairs, Q the number of discordant
    pairs, T the number of ties only in `x`, and U the number of ties only in
    `y`.  If a tie occurs for the same pair in both `x` and `y`, it is not
    added to either T or U. n is the total number of samples, and m is the
    number of unique values in either `x` or `y`, whichever is smaller.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider the following data from [6]_, which studied the relationship
    between free proline (an amino acid) and total collagen (a protein often
    found in connective tissue) in unhealthy human livers.

    The ``x`` and ``y`` arrays below record measurements of the two compounds.
    The observations are paired: each free proline measurement was taken from
    the same liver as the total collagen measurement at the same index.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> # total collagen (mg/g dry weight of liver)
    >>> x = np.array([7.1, 7.1, 7.2, 8.3, 9.4, 10.5, 11.4])
    >>> # free proline (μ mole/g dry weight of liver)
    >>> y = np.array([2.8, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6, 3.5, 4.6, 5.0])

    These data were analyzed in [7]_ using Spearman's correlation coefficient,
    a statistic similar to to Kendall's tau in that it is also sensitive to
    ordinal correlation between the samples. Let's perform an analogous study
    using Kendall's tau.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.kendalltau(x, y)
    >>> res.statistic
    0.5499999999999999

    The value of this statistic tends to be high (close to 1) for samples with
    a strongly positive ordinal correlation, low (close to -1) for samples with
    a strongly negative ordinal correlation, and small in magnitude (close to
    zero) for samples with weak ordinal correlation.

    The test is performed by comparing the observed value of the
    statistic against the null distribution: the distribution of statistic
    values derived under the null hypothesis that total collagen and free
    proline measurements are independent.

    For this test, the null distribution for large samples without ties is
    approximated as the normal distribution with variance
    ``(2*(2*n + 5))/(9*n*(n - 1))``, where ``n = len(x)``.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> n = len(x)  # len(x) == len(y)
    >>> var = (2*(2*n + 5))/(9*n*(n - 1))
    >>> dist = stats.norm(scale=np.sqrt(var))
    >>> z_vals = np.linspace(-1.25, 1.25, 100)
    >>> pdf = dist.pdf(z_vals)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> def plot(ax):  # we'll reuse this
    ...     ax.plot(z_vals, pdf)
    ...     ax.set_title("Kendall Tau Test Null Distribution")
    ...     ax.set_xlabel("statistic")
    ...     ax.set_ylabel("probability density")
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> plt.show()

    The comparison is quantified by the p-value: the proportion of values in
    the null distribution as extreme or more extreme than the observed
    value of the statistic. In a two-sided test in which the statistic is
    positive, elements of the null distribution greater than the transformed
    statistic and elements of the null distribution less than the negative of
    the observed statistic are both considered "more extreme".

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> pvalue = dist.cdf(-res.statistic) + dist.sf(res.statistic)
    >>> annotation = (f'p-value={pvalue:.4f}\n(shaded area)')
    >>> props = dict(facecolor='black', width=1, headwidth=5, headlength=8)
    >>> _ = ax.annotate(annotation, (0.65, 0.15), (0.8, 0.3), arrowprops=props)
    >>> i = z_vals >= res.statistic
    >>> ax.fill_between(z_vals[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> i = z_vals <= -res.statistic
    >>> ax.fill_between(z_vals[i], y1=0, y2=pdf[i], color='C0')
    >>> ax.set_xlim(-1.25, 1.25)
    >>> ax.set_ylim(0, 0.5)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.09108705741631495  # approximate p-value

    Note that there is slight disagreement between the shaded area of the curve
    and the p-value returned by `kendalltau`. This is because our data has
    ties, and we have neglected a tie correction to the null distribution
    variance that `kendalltau` performs. For samples without ties, the shaded
    areas of our plot and p-value returned by `kendalltau` would match exactly.

    If the p-value is "small" - that is, if there is a low probability of
    sampling data from independent distributions that produces such an extreme
    value of the statistic - this may be taken as evidence against the null
    hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the distribution of total collagen
    and free proline are *not* independent. Note that:

    - The inverse is not true; that is, the test is not used to provide
      evidence for the null hypothesis.
    - The threshold for values that will be considered "small" is a choice that
      should be made before the data is analyzed [8]_ with consideration of the
      risks of both false positives (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis)
      and false negatives (failure to reject a false null hypothesis).
    - Small p-values are not evidence for a *large* effect; rather, they can
      only provide evidence for a "significant" effect, meaning that they are
      unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.

    For samples without ties of moderate size, `kendalltau` can compute the
    p-value exactly. However, in the presence of ties, `kendalltau` resorts
    to an asymptotic approximation. Nonetheles, we can use a permutation test
    to compute the null distribution exactly: Under the null hypothesis that
    total collagen and free proline are independent, each of the free proline
    measurements were equally likely to have been observed with any of the
    total collagen measurements. Therefore, we can form an *exact* null
    distribution by calculating the statistic under each possible pairing of
    elements between ``x`` and ``y``.

    >>> def statistic(x):  # explore all possible pairings by permuting `x`
    ...     return stats.kendalltau(x, y).statistic  # ignore pvalue
    >>> ref = stats.permutation_test((x,), statistic,
    ...                              permutation_type='pairings')
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> bins = np.linspace(-1.25, 1.25, 25)
    >>> ax.hist(ref.null_distribution, bins=bins, density=True)
    >>> ax.legend(['aymptotic approximation\n(many observations)',
    ...            'exact null distribution'])
    >>> plot(ax)
    >>> plt.show()
    >>> ref.pvalue
    0.12222222222222222  # exact p-value

    Note that there is significant disagreement between the exact p-value
    calculated here and the approximation returned by `kendalltau` above. For
    small samples with ties, consider performing a permutation test for more
    accurate results.

def weightedtau(x, y, rank=True, weigher=None, additive=True):
    r"""Compute a weighted version of Kendall's :math:`\tau`.

    The weighted :math:`\tau` is a weighted version of Kendall's
    :math:`\tau` in which exchanges of high weight are more influential than
    exchanges of low weight. The default parameters compute the additive
    hyperbolic version of the index, :math:`\tau_\mathrm h`, which has
    been shown to provide the best balance between important and
    unimportant elements [1]_.

    The weighting is defined by means of a rank array, which assigns a
    nonnegative rank to each element (higher importance ranks being
    associated with smaller values, e.g., 0 is the highest possible rank),
    and a weigher function, which assigns a weight based on the rank to
    each element. The weight of an exchange is then the sum or the product
    of the weights of the ranks of the exchanged elements. The default
    parameters compute :math:`\tau_\mathrm h`: an exchange between
    elements with rank :math:`r` and :math:`s` (starting from zero) has
    weight :math:`1/(r+1) + 1/(s+1)`.

    Specifying a rank array is meaningful only if you have in mind an
    external criterion of importance. If, as it usually happens, you do
    not have in mind a specific rank, the weighted :math:`\tau` is
    defined by averaging the values obtained using the decreasing
    lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) and by (`y`, `x`). This is the
    behavior with default parameters. Note that the convention used
    here for ranking (lower values imply higher importance) is opposite
    to that used by other SciPy statistical functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of scores, of the same shape. If arrays are not 1-D, they will
        be flattened to 1-D.
    rank : array_like of ints or bool, optional
        A nonnegative rank assigned to each element. If it is None, the
        decreasing lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) will be used: elements of
        higher rank will be those with larger `x`-values, using `y`-values to
        break ties (in particular, swapping `x` and `y` will give a different
        result). If it is False, the element indices will be used
        directly as ranks. The default is True, in which case this
        function returns the average of the values obtained using the
        decreasing lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) and by (`y`, `x`).
    weigher : callable, optional
        The weigher function. Must map nonnegative integers (zero
        representing the most important element) to a nonnegative weight.
        The default, None, provides hyperbolic weighing, that is,
        rank :math:`r` is mapped to weight :math:`1/(r+1)`.
    additive : bool, optional
        If True, the weight of an exchange is computed by adding the
        weights of the ranks of the exchanged elements; otherwise, the weights
        are multiplied. The default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    res: SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
           The weighted :math:`\tau` correlation index.
        pvalue : float
           Presently ``np.nan``, as the null distribution of the statistic is
           unknown (even in the additive hyperbolic case).

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses an :math:`O(n \log n)`, mergesort-based algorithm
    [1]_ that is a weighted extension of Knight's algorithm for Kendall's
    :math:`\tau` [2]_. It can compute Shieh's weighted :math:`\tau` [3]_
    between rankings without ties (i.e., permutations) by setting
    `additive` and `rank` to False, as the definition given in [1]_ is a
    generalization of Shieh's.

    NaNs are considered the smallest possible score.

    Specifically, for each point, MGC finds the :math:`k`-nearest neighbors for
    one property (e.g. cloud density), and the :math:`l`-nearest neighbors for
    the other property (e.g. grass wetness) [1]_. This pair :math:`(k, l)` is
    called the "scale". A priori, however, it is not know which scales will be
    most informative. So, MGC computes all distance pairs, and then efficiently
    computes the distance correlations for all scales. The local correlations
    illustrate which scales are relatively informative about the relationship.
    The key, therefore, to successfully discover and decipher relationships
    between disparate data modalities is to adaptively determine which scales
    are the most informative, and the geometric implication for the most
    informative scales. Doing so not only provides an estimate of whether the
    modalities are related, but also provides insight into how the
    determination was made. This is especially important in high-dimensional
    data, where simple visualizations do not reveal relationships to the
    unaided human eye. Characterizations of this implementation in particular
    have been derived from and benchmarked within in [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : ndarray
        If ``x`` and ``y`` have shapes ``(n, p)`` and ``(n, q)`` where `n` is
        the number of samples and `p` and `q` are the number of dimensions,
        then the MGC independence test will be run.  Alternatively, ``x`` and
        ``y`` can have shapes ``(n, n)`` if they are distance or similarity
        matrices, and ``compute_distance`` must be sent to ``None``. If ``x``
        and ``y`` have shapes ``(n, p)`` and ``(m, p)``, an unpaired
        two-sample MGC test will be run.
    compute_distance : callable, optional
        A function that computes the distance or similarity among the samples
        within each data matrix. Set to ``None`` if ``x`` and ``y`` are
        already distance matrices. The default uses the euclidean norm metric.
        If you are calling a custom function, either create the distance
        matrix before-hand or create a function of the form
        ``compute_distance(x)`` where `x` is the data matrix for which
        pairwise distances are calculated.
    reps : int, optional
        The number of replications used to estimate the null when using the
        permutation test. The default is ``1000``.
    workers : int or map-like callable, optional
        If ``workers`` is an int the population is subdivided into ``workers``
        sections and evaluated in parallel (uses ``multiprocessing.Pool
        <multiprocessing>``). Supply ``-1`` to use all cores available to the
        Process. Alternatively supply a map-like callable, such as
        ``multiprocessing.Pool.map`` for evaluating the p-value in parallel.
        This evaluation is carried out as ``workers(func, iterable)``.
        Requires that `func` be pickleable. The default is ``1``.
    is_twosamp : bool, optional
        If `True`, a two sample test will be run. If ``x`` and ``y`` have
        shapes ``(n, p)`` and ``(m, p)``, this optional will be overridden and
        set to ``True``. Set to ``True`` if ``x`` and ``y`` both have shapes
        ``(n, p)`` and a two sample test is desired. The default is ``False``.
        Note that this will not run if inputs are distance matrices.
    random_state : {None, int, `numpy.random.Generator`,
                    `numpy.random.RandomState`}, optional

        If `seed` is None (or `np.random`), the `numpy.random.RandomState`
        singleton is used.
        If `seed` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
        seeded with `seed`.
        If `seed` is already a ``Generator`` or ``RandomState`` instance then
        that instance is used.

    Returns
    -------
    res : MGCResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
            The sample MGC test statistic within `[-1, 1]`.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value obtained via permutation.
        mgc_dict : dict
            Contains additional useful results:

                - mgc_map : ndarray
                    A 2D representation of the latent geometry of the

                - opt_scale : (int, int)
                    The estimated optimal scale as a `(x, y)` pair.
                - null_dist : list
                    The null distribution derived from the permuted matrices.

    Notes
    -----
    A description of the process of MGC and applications on neuroscience data
    can be found in [1]_. It is performed using the following steps:

    #. Two distance matrices :math:`D^X` and :math:`D^Y` are computed and
       modified to be mean zero columnwise. This results in two
       :math:`n \times n` distance matrices :math:`A` and :math:`B` (the
       centering and unbiased modification) [3]_.

    #. For all values :math:`k` and :math:`l` from :math:`1, ..., n`,

       * The :math:`k`-nearest neighbor and :math:`l`-nearest neighbor graphs
         are calculated for each property. Here, :math:`G_k (i, j)` indicates
         the :math:`k`-smallest values of the :math:`i`-th row of :math:`A`
         and :math:`H_l (i, j)` indicates the :math:`l` smallested values of
         the :math:`i`-th row of :math:`B`

       * Let :math:`\circ` denotes the entry-wise matrix product, then local
         correlations are summed and normalized using the following statistic:

    .. math::

        c^{kl} = \frac{\sum_{ij} A G_k B H_l}
                      {\sqrt{\sum_{ij} A^2 G_k \times \sum_{ij} B^2 H_l}}

    #. The MGC test statistic is the smoothed optimal local correlation of
       :math:`\{ c^{kl} \}`. Denote the smoothing operation as :math:`R(\cdot)`
       (which essentially set all isolated large correlations) as 0 and
       connected large correlations the same as before, see [3]_.) MGC is,

    .. math::

        MGC_n (x, y) = \max_{(k, l)} R \left(c^{kl} \left( x_n, y_n \right)
                                                    \right)

    The test statistic returns a value between :math:`(-1, 1)` since it is
    normalized.

    The p-value returned is calculated using a permutation test. This process
    is completed by first randomly permuting :math:`y` to estimate the null
    distribution and then calculating the probability of observing a test
    statistic, under the null, at least as extreme as the observed test
    statistic.

    MGC requires at least 5 samples to run with reliable results. It can also
    handle high-dimensional data sets.
    In addition, by manipulating the input data matrices, the two-sample
    testing problem can be reduced to the independence testing problem [4]_.
    Given sample data :math:`U` and :math:`V` of sizes :math:`p \times n`
    :math:`p \times m`, data matrix :math:`X` and :math:`Y` can be created as
    follows:

    .. math::

        X = [U | V] \in \mathcal{R}^{p \times (n + m)}
        Y = [0_{1 \times n} | 1_{1 \times m}] \in \mathcal{R}^{(n + m)}

    Then, the MGC statistic can be calculated as normal. This methodology can
    be extended to similar tests such as distance correlation [4]_.

            fields `low` and `high`.

            .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Notes
    -----
    The statistic is calculated as ``(np.mean(a) - popmean)/se``, where
    ``se`` is the standard error. Therefore, the statistic will be positive
    when the sample mean is greater than the population mean and negative when
    the sample mean is less than the population mean.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that the mean of a population
    is equal to 0.5. We choose a confidence level of 99%; that is, we will
    reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the p-value is
    less than 0.01.

    When testing random variates from the standard uniform distribution, which
    has a mean of 0.5, we expect the data to be consistent with the null
    hypothesis most of the time.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> rvs = stats.uniform.rvs(size=50, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5)
    TtestResult(statistic=2.456308468440, pvalue=0.017628209047638, df=49)

    As expected, the p-value of 0.017 is not below our threshold of 0.01, so
    we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

    When testing data from the standard *normal* distribution, which has a mean
    of 0, we would expect the null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=50, random_state=rng)
    >>> stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5)
    TtestResult(statistic=-7.433605518875, pvalue=1.416760157221e-09, df=49)

    Indeed, the p-value is lower than our threshold of 0.01, so we reject the
    null hypothesis in favor of the default "two-sided" alternative: the mean
    of the population is *not* equal to 0.5.

    However, suppose we were to test the null hypothesis against the
    one-sided alternative that the mean of the population is *greater* than
    0.5. Since the mean of the standard normal is less than 0.5, we would not
    expect the null hypothesis to be rejected.

    >>> stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5, alternative='greater')
    TtestResult(statistic=-7.433605518875, pvalue=0.99999999929, df=49)

    Unsurprisingly, with a p-value greater than our threshold, we would not
    reject the null hypothesis.

    Note that when working with a confidence level of 99%, a true null
    hypothesis will be rejected approximately 1% of the time.

    >>> rvs = stats.uniform.rvs(size=(100, 50), random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0.5, axis=1)
    >>> np.sum(res.pvalue < 0.01)
    1

    Indeed, even though all 100 samples above were drawn from the standard
    uniform distribution, which *does* have a population mean of 0.5, we would
    mistakenly reject the null hypothesis for one of them.

    `ttest_1samp` can also compute a confidence interval around the population
    mean.

    >>> rvs = stats.norm.rvs(size=50, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=0)
    >>> ci = res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)
    >>> ci
    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.3193887540880017, high=0.2898583388980972)

    The bounds of the 95% confidence interval are the
    minimum and maximum values of the parameter `popmean` for which the
    p-value of the test would be 0.05.

    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=ci.low)
    >>> np.testing.assert_allclose(res.pvalue, 0.05)
    >>> res = stats.ttest_1samp(rvs, popmean=ci.high)
    >>> np.testing.assert_allclose(res.pvalue, 0.05)

    Under certain assumptions about the population from which a sample
    is drawn, the confidence interval with confidence level 95% is expected
    to contain the true population mean in 95% of sample replications.
